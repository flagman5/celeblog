					<h3>Is Jessica Simpson Pregnant?</h3>
					<img src="celeb/jsp.jpg">
					<p>
					From the looks of this picture, it does not seem like it. 
					It seems like she only put up some extra weight. 
					The dress is so tight that it is showing her little belly which I believe is not a baby but just pure lard.
					<br/><br/>
					Nothing wrong with a little cushion for the pushing. Besides, it is so difficult to stay on a weight target if you can eat gourmet food every meal,
					have people shop your groceries and getting nothing but the finest types of foods from Morton Williams or Dean and Deluca. 
					If I was in her position, I would definitely take advantage of all the food and enjoy life to the fullest. 
					Therefore conclusion: shes not pregnant.
